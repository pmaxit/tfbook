> One stop solution for Tensorflow information

This notebook will contain examples from Machine Learning domain and their implementation in Tensorflow. This was done part of my learning process but I tried to make it little presentable to be able to share my knowledge with others.

### How do I get started?

Go through couple of examples. They should be categorized in multiple groups as following:

1. Tensorflow
  - FizzBuzz
2. Transformers
  - Bert


Although, that's just what I had in mind when I was writing this README.md. Things may change.
