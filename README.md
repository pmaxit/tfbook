# Introduction

This repository hosts couple of examples from Tensorflow & Keras library. Idea is to create a go-to repository for any kind of machine learning problem and get code snippets to help in the task

# Structure
Structure of this project is divided into few main sections
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
